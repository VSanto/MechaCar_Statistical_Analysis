## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

* Vehicle length and vehicle ground clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.
   
* The slope of the linear model is not to be considered zero, because the estimates for all the coefficients are not zero. 

* This linear model does effectively predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes. The Adjusted R-Sqaured has a value of 68.25% for all MPG predictions, which the coefficients help explain.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

*  The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. The data      shows that the current manufacturing data meets the design specification for the T-Test and all lots.

#### The following PSI metrics for each lot: mean, median, variance, and standard deviation.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Comptition

How MechaCar preforms against the comptition.  
   * A T-Test can be used to compare Safety Ratings throughout the industry.
   * The null hypothesis would show NO difference in safety ratings with the compitition.
   * The alternative hypothesis would suggest a differnce in the safety ratings with the compitition.
   * Additional analysis using the results of the T-Test should provide more information.
