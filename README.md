## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

* Vehicle length and vehicle ground clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.
   
* The slope of the linear model is not to be considered zero, because the estimates for all the coefficients are not zero. 

* This linear model does effectively predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes. The Adjusted R-Sqaured has a value of 68.25% for all MPG predictions, which the coefficients help explain.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

*  The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. The data      shows that the current manufacturing data meets the design specification for lot1 and lot2, but lot3 does not meet the design specifications as the vairance is much    higher than allowed variance.

#### The following PSI metrics for each lot: mean, median, variance, and standard deviation.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Comptition

* What metric or metrics are you going to test?

* What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?

* What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?

*  What data is needed to run the statistical test?
